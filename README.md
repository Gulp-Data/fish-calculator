## sample output

### Background on Gulp

> 3,800+ valuations, $3B+ data valued, 3T+ records valued, 150K+ market comps behind the valuations

#### Background on the method

Our data value calculator leverages insights from previous valuations conducted by Gulp Data, focusing on data assets similar to yours. Unlike our market-comp models, which are based on actual market data and transactions, the data value calculator derives its insights from Gulp Data's prior in-house valuations of assets similar to yours. This method doesnâ€™t rely on real-time market comparisons but instead applies patterns and valuation criteria we've established from assessing comparable data types.
